## Why
Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) play many vital roles, not the least of which are protecting, saving and restoring lives.  That’s why they deserve access to the same information and technology that the private sector, governments and intergovernmental agencies use to improve their decision-making.  Business Intelligence (BI) has come to represent a suite of tools that improve decision-making across organizations, that’s why the aim of BI4NGOs is bring the strengths of Business Intelligence (BI) to the vast and complex data-set of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).
