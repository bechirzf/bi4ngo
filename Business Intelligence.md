## Business Intelligence (BI)

### What is Business Intelligence (BI)?

Business Intelligence is often referring to the technologies used to transform raw data into meaningful data for business analysis.  However it has come to represent a suite of [tools and techniques](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/) that utilize the computational capabilities of computers to process large amounts of data.

Typical functions of BI technologies are reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics.

[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/business-intelligence) says that “Business intelligence (BI) simplifies information discovery and analysis, making it possible for decision-makers at all levels of an organization to more easily access, understand, analyze, collaborate, and act on information, anytime and anywhere.”

“BI is the process of analyzing your organization’s accumulated raw data and extracting useful insight from it.” MicroStrategy

“BI provides decisions makes the right information, at the right time, in the right place, enabling them to make better business decisions.” MicroStrategy

Business Intelligence is most effective when organisational (internal) data is combined with market (external) data providing a more complete picture for organisations to navigate.  The data discovered by business intelligence technologies looks at the past, present and future and supports a spectrum of business decision-making needs from operations to strategy.

“Business Intelligence (BI) helps us keep track of what really works and what doesn’t.” Bill Gates
